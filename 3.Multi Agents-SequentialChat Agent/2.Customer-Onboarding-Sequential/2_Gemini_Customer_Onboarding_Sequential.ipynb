Since you're from Sivakasi, the \"Printing Capital of India\",  I bet you appreciate a good book!  Did you know that the Gutenberg Bible, one of the first major books printed using movable type, was a Latin version of the Bible, including the Gospels?  Talk about printing history meeting biblical history!\n",

Matthew portrays Jesus as the fulfilled Jewish Messiah, Mark presents a fast-paced, action-packed account, Luke emphasizes Jesus' compassion for the marginalized, and John shares a more theological and reflective perspective.  Think of it like four different friends telling the same story – each adding their own flavor!\n",
